## About This Project  

The Personal Expense Tracker is a small but powerful desktop application I built to strengthen my skills in **Python programming, GUI development, and data visualization**.  

I wanted to create something practical that demonstrates:  
- Building an interactive **Tkinter GUI**  
- Handling **persistent data storage** with JSON  
- Performing **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Summarizing and visualizing data with **Matplotlib**  

This project is simple enough to be approachable, but it showcases a full set of programming concepts that employers value: front-end design (Tkinter), back-end logic (Python functions), and visualization (Matplotlib).  

It’s also **personally useful** — I can log daily expenses, fix mistakes, delete entries, and track spending trends over time.
